# **Detecting Counterfeit Product Reviews Using AI & Machine Learning**

### **Overview**
With the rise of e-commerce, online reviews have become a critical factor in shaping consumer purchasing decisions. However, fake reviews generated by automated bots and malicious actors have led to widespread misinformation, influencing sales and consumer trust. This project aims to **detect and classify counterfeit product reviews** using advanced **machine learning and deep learning techniques**.

### **Problem Statement**
The surge of AI-generated and bot-driven fake reviews has made it challenging for consumers to distinguish genuine feedback from manipulated content. This research leverages NLP models to detect and filter out fraudulent reviews, ensuring a **transparent and trustworthy online marketplace**.

### **Approach**
We implemented a **hybrid model** using traditional machine learning, deep learning, and transformer-based models to identify fake product reviews. The models used include:
- **Traditional Machine Learning:** Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Deep Learning:** Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) & Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- **Transformer-Based Models:** BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, DistilBERT

Each model was evaluated based on **accuracy, weighted F1-score, and computational efficiency**, with **DistilBERT** emerging as the most effective solution.

### **Key Features**
✅ **Data-Driven Analysis**: Preprocessed and cleaned dataset containing both real and AI-generated fake reviews.  
✅ **Advanced NLP Techniques**: Used **TF-IDF**, **word embeddings**, and **transformer models** for text analysis.  
✅ **Deep Learning Models**: Compared multiple deep learning architectures to determine the best approach.  
✅ **Performance Metrics**: Evaluated models based on **precision, recall, F1-score, and computational time**.  
✅ **Future Potential**: Can be extended to **news articles, social media comments, or other text-based fraud detection tasks**.

### **Results**
- **DistilBERT** outperformed other models, achieving **98% accuracy** with optimized computational efficiency.
- Traditional ML models like **SVM** performed decently but lacked the contextual understanding of deep learning models.
- The hybrid approach using **CNN-LSTM** demonstrated strong potential for real-time applications.
